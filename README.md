# RELATIVE VELOCITY
<h4> Synopsis about our project </h4>

We are developing a project for relative velocity experiment simulation.
It will be like,if we give details about one or two objects then here find relative velocity and show above object movement.
This project most important to advance level students for their studies.
Here we used jquery and bootstrap packages , in languages we used html and javascript.

<h4> examples for codeing </h4>



<h4> Motivation </h4>

we created our project as a our 3rd year projet.here evry one week we doing our updates and our aim to help a/l students.
we created our project using a/l syllabus.

<h4> Installation </h4>


<h4> API Reference </h4>


<h4> Tests </h4>
In here for one object have two cases: 
	(1)Relative to Ground
		
		->		->		->
		V(o,r)=V(o,g)+V(g,r)
		
		using this formula we can find 
			(1)object relative velocity to river (V(o,r)) 
			(2)degree relative to river (alpha)
			(3)distance object swim (l) = width of river/cos(alpha)
			(4)dista of object from opposite end of starting (s) = width of river/sin(alpha)
			(5)time to reach other end (t) = distance object swim (l)/V(o,r)
	
	(2)Relative to river
		->		->		->
		V(o,g)=V(o,r)+V(r,g)
		
		using this formula we can find 
			(1)object relative velocity to river (V(o,g)) 
			(2)degree relative to river (alpha)
			(3)distance object swim (l) = width of river/cos(alpha)
			(4)dista of object from opposite end of starting (s) = width of river/sin(alpha)
			(5)time to reach other end (t) = distance object swim (l)/V(o,r)
			
In here for two object have
