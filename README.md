# RELATIVE VELOCITY
<h4> Synopsis about our project </h4>

We are developing a project for relative velocity experiment simulation.If we give details which we have about one or two objects 
then here find relative velocity and show above object movement.This project most important to students for their studies.relavant
to this simulations shown in the project there are problems in finding relative velocity(mechanics in Physics and in aplied mathamatics).
Also lecturer can use this simulation to give lectures

we used jquery,bootstrap, html,css and javascript.

<h4> Getting started </h4>

this can use online or download the relative velocity folder and run the index.html file on your browser.
Click on the instruction button to know how to give data for simulation.

<h4> Tests </h4>
 for one object case object can have two chances for velocity: 
	(1)Velocity Relative to Ground
	(2)Velocity to river
		->	->	->
		V(o,r)=V(o,g)+V(r,g)
		
		->	->	->
		V(o,g)=V(o,r)+V(r,g)
		
	 we find the details which is not given when either of above case occur.
			(1)object relative velocity to river
			(2)object relative velocity to ground
			(3)degree relative to river
			(4)distance object swim when pass the river
			(5)distance of object from "opposite end of starting" to end position 
			(6)time to reach other end
	

			
 	two object have velocities for objects and starting distance.That case find the following details
			(1)having shortest distance or not
			(2)if the objects are meeting 
			(3)if meeting or have shortest distance time taken to that situation
			(4)relative velocities  relative to other object
			(5)bearing
