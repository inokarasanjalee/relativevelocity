<h4>Contributing </h4>

Thank you for your interest in contributing to "Relative Velocity"  project .

<h4>Our project vision </h4>
Who Studies relative motion ,this projects helps to do calculation  and simulation very easily .<br>

Here we have two cases<br>
1.you can get clear idea about the motion of object on the medium which is moving. You find the motion relative to earth and how much time taken the pass that medium.<br>
2.When two object moving on a medium which is not moving how the relativity to each other .To find the shortest distance among them, time taken to when shortest distance occur.<br>
